## Let's start!

We present to you the **"Employee's Hapinness Tracking Tool"** or **EHTT**, to speed things up. EHTT, is an application that helps the user to track the happiness level of the people related to their company.

Each person will have the following properties:

* Name
* Category (employee or manager)
* Company name
* Happiness level

You want you to list the people and allow searching through them by their name or category. The results should also includes the logo of their company and the posibility to be sorted by happiness level, category or company in an ascending or descending order.

We also want users to select which people to track, like a favorite list, to check how they evolve. We recommend showing the favorite list inside a modal that can be easily accessed by the navbar.

In the favorite modal, I want to be able to search by name, category and company and have the posibility to remove the people from the favorite list, without having to close it.

Try to use pagination for the lintings! We recommend showing 5 at the time.

## Initial material

You need to create a JSON file with the information and an "images" folder with the company's logo.

## Delivery requirements

You can use any startegy you prefer for storing the favorites list and persistence is not required. The solution must run properly and a text file with any instruction required for running it should be provided.
